# The Player (Poem 21)  
#### March 14, 2021       
      
I took my girl to the park,  
To ride the ferris wheel  
And when we hit the top  
A kiss, I plan to steal.  
  
The passionate peak of romance  
The height, the view, the lust  
Above the noisy crowds  
Above the dirt and dust  
  
We board the might ferris  
And shut our cart's white door  
She’s in for such a treat tonight  
A ride (and a little more)  
  
The wheel, it starts a'turnin'  
Our bucket starts to rise  
I hold my girlfriends shaking hand  
And look her in the eyes.  
  
And then our cart gets higher  
And boy, it’s such a thrill  
I hold the sides of our cart  
To try to keep it still.  
  
But the wind is shifting sideway  
And rocking us to and fro  
Our cart is climbing higher  
We’re at the top. I hope.  
  
I’m shaking from the fear now  
‘Please let us down!’ I think  
When steadies our white cart above  
The wheel and bumper rink.  
  
‘Kiss her?! Are you kidding me?  
On the most perilous of rides!?  
I’m not gonna move at all, I think,  
I’m holding to the sides!’  
  
And when the ride was over  
And I calmed from being frantic  
She took me to the side and said  
She thought it was romantic.
