> While the "story" here doesn't really make sense, every individual line references real technology. It's fun to see how fast you can read it.   
  
If you recompile kernels and you're running beta apps   
Or you're checking files out of git, committing this and that   
You understand most Perl scripts or you're scripting from the shell   
Or you've read and can discuss the finer points of GPL.  
  
If you've programmed in assembly or your apps are built from source    
If your website's running Ruby built on Rails forms, of course   
If keep abreast of Android's press or've patched an app for free   
If you know who Linus T is, or you're running BSD  
  
If you suck up power every day, computer's always on,   
Your system's maintenance is a breeze because you're running cron   
Your IP masquerades and your MAC address is hidden   
If your VPN blocks pop-ups because the ad domain's forbidden   
  
If your files need some folders 'cause your desktop is a mess  
So you spin a storage bucket up in AWS   
If your queries run too slowly 'cause your SQL's filled with joins  
Or your GPU is overheating mining crypto-coins  
  
You actually like vi or emacs: either one   
Your home DHCP is served by something made by SUN   
When facing problem apps you simply sit and code a fix,   
Or the network in your house is running IP version 6.  
  
While the packet switching networks switch the packets filling frames   
And encoded MP3s were piped from console out through lame   
Then iSCSI drives whose terabyte arrays run chrooted jails   
Your running ZFS and praying backups never fail  
  
If your firewall is representing public TCP   
And your ports have all been monitored and blocked on 23   
Then your bytes are all encrypted and your private IP's safe   
Cause you're mashing all your traffic through a tunneled SSH.  
  
Your hostname isn't set up right and printers aren't shared   
Li'l Snitch reports activity that leaves you running scared   
Your buffer overflows are caused by memory allocation   
'Cause your Linux install still had holes at time of installation.  
  
If your sendmail stops responding since you shut down your backdoor   
Or Apache doesn't serve a page besides your 404   
You find your resource hanged because you're running games through WINE    
Then you're left with little option but to issue kill dash nine.  
  
If your Ruby code is choking, you forgot an "end"  
Or your server just won't relay any email that you send   
When you can't find all the man pages and not sure where to go   
And you've googled all the answers and perused Stack Overflow    
  
When your daemons cause a kernel panic, forcing a reboot   
Or your system logs report a process logging in as root   
You can try to watch parameters that pass at time of boot   
But you'll find you're pwned and have to phone a techie more astute  
  
You can't remember switches of commands you try to pass   
You read O'Reilly books so you can finish all your tasks  
A troll who flames your weblog thinks he's king of your domain   
And his posts are mostly worthless and his comments all inane   
  
Your curly braces wrapping lines are off because you slipped   
And somewhere there's semi-colon throwing off your script  
A twitter trend alerts you to another breach today -   
Surprise! They've just announced that there's a brand new zero-day.   
  
Your admins check a troll's IP, his netblock's AOL   
Your moderators have to deal with moderation hell.  
If your RPMs are failing cause you're missing glibc   
And you're sick of packed up tarballs cause they need dependancies   
  
But just when you grow confident you've set the proper locks,   
Your mother gets a virus on his her Windows 7 box   
While you fool with DOS command line tools like format backslash C:   
You can map a drive to Samba so you backup her PC.  
  
I've downed my Linux Mint install but s'pose I could go back   
Given all the latest Windows viruses and trojans, worms, and hacks  
Your AV finds another app that's spyware on your drive  
But AV itself's a rootkit - what a time to be alive!  
  
When the latest app you need to try is packaged as a JAR   
So just to check for safety you unzip the thing with tar  
A buffer overflow you found with grep -i -r  
You take a chance and run it cause you've got ASLR    
  
Now no one should be expert here in every single way -   
No matter what lame-ass posts on Reddit have to say,   
So boot your server running Plex that's serving from your SAN     
And be glad you've got a life outside of just computers, man.
