# Sonnet #2 (Poem 2)
#### March 5, 2021

A gentle breeze came softly from the west  
each blooming flower turned to face the east  
I stood atop a hill and paused there, lest  
I miss the flowers as they hailed me.  
I wished that I could share the moment, then  
A moment that two lovers shouldnâ€™t miss:  
The flowers bowed before me, gently bent,  
each puckered petal offering a kiss  
And as I stood, a God amongst the green  
the breeze began to wane and back away  
I closed to my eyes to capture this rare scene  
as flowers turned to face the proper way.  
The orchestrated beauty nature calls,  
if they should pause, available to all.
