# The Grand Flight of Speech (Poem 25)   
#### March 23, 2021     
    
> This one is from roughly 1996. It’s so interesting to read my inexperience in poetry and in life, the naïveté that is equal parts embarrassing to read, but also foundational in helping me find the kind of poetry I wanted to write.   
  
Further and further,  
thoughts bump along the runway  
I’m closer to nothing  
than I’ve ever been  
And yet somehow, some way  
I feel I’m moving forward  
whatever that is.  
  
But what is forward, anyway?   
What is it to propel yourself forward?  
Is it to increase your knowledge?  
to plan for the future?  
to make friends?  
to make money?   
to prepare for death?  
  
I think about books sometimes.  
So precise – so concise!  
They start. They end.  
When I begin reading, I have a definitive goal.  
I prepare for when the story is over,  
It has a certain number of pages.   
I know when I'm getting close to the final chapter.   
I end with the satisfaction of a great story.  
Life’s final chapter is, too often, not a happy ending.  
There is no moral to be extracted – no antihero whose traits I adopt  
  
I also think about my watch.  
The hands click along –   
the smooth sweep of that second hand!  
Those hands circle round and round,  
They charge on with purpose,   
seemingly traveling in a direction  
seemingly headed towards a destination.  
They have no destination but infinity.  
  
I think about my friends and family – and somewhere in there  
I see my smiling grandmother.  
I remember her dying  
I don't know if she lived a full life  
I don't know how funny she was  
I don't know if she regretted her decisions  
but she was always happy, simply because I was there.    
In those moments, I think maybe I understand what “forward” is.  
Whereas I used to be a watch —  
I’m now more like a book.
