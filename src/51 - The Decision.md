# The Decision (Poem 51)

> I love the idea of leaving the reader unsatisfied and arguably angry.   
  
Whiffling through the turgid wood   
Upon a fork in the road, I stood  
To turn due East, head towards the sun  
Or West instead, I had to choose one   
   
Which way could my fair maiden be?   
Which angle brings her back to me?   
As anger burbled in my voice  
I struggled having to make a choice   
   
I glanced to East and spied the road  
An endless field looked freshly mowed  
A village – shops and merchants and schools  
Adorned with gold and silver and jewels  
   
But to the West, shan’t be left untold  
A sight one truly must behold  
Healthy fields packed full of fruit  
A city of riches, endless loot  
   
But to the East the sun shone bright   
A warming glow of morning light  
The sound of townsfolk stopping, meeting,  
Smiling, laughing, waving, greeting.  
   
The West was darker, this is true,   
The folks began to wake anew  
The bustle of people, with no warning  
Whispering to their friends, “Good morning!”  
   
But then my eyes drew back to East  
To walk that road, and have a feast  
And then to find my b'loved princess  
Who still remained is in such distress  
   
That would mean, sadly, not going West  
A path I might believe is best  
She could be there, and worth the hassle,   
To rescue her from a bad guy’s castle  
   
What if the castle is in the East?   
A wizard hiding, in the form of a beast  
Could have her under lock and key  
Unless she’s rescued soon, by me  
   
In the distance, East, I see the beach   
The foaming water within its reach  
I stretch my arm out and point my hand   
To the crash of waves upon the land  
   
In the West, the other shore is seen   
The water reflects an early sheen   
A trick of the eye or maybe a sign   
The light dances gently on the rocky shoreline  
   
It’s time to focus all my vision  
Take a breath and make a decision  
Will I head East towards the sun  
Or turn to the West, decision: done?   
   
Before I make the call, I listen  
The flowers blow, the dew drops glisten  
I think I hear a distance voice  
Cajoling me to make a choice   
   
My princess, she is calling me!  
I hear her voice, clear as can be  
She tells me “head towards the shore”  
But then trails off, I couldn’t hear more  
   
“The shore I see in distant East?”   
I yelled to the air, echoing off the trees  
"Or maybe the shore, seen off to the West  
is the path that, to find her, would be best?"   
  
Without conviction - an admission -   
I resigned to my decision   
I would head East and find my bride  
And leave with her, right by my side  
  
But then, before first footfall lands,   
I had a doubt, I change of plans  
I focused all my inner wrath   
And turned towards the western path   
  
And there I stood, upon the trail  
My heart, inside, began to ail   
As thoughts rushed by in hurried rhyme  
I knew I was running out of time   
  
I glanced ahead towards the West  
The trail here seemed rough, at best   
The darkness, though still getting lighter  
Made the East seem, maybe, righter.   
  
The East, however, if I hustle  
Would lead me away from city bustle  
And if I choose there and was wrong  
The trail back would be twice as long  
  
I drew my blade towards the sky  
Cried "Help me, Goddess, find my bride  
I beg thee, Harvest Goddess, Lord,   
Please help me, won't thou guide my sword?"   
  
I felt the heavy blade pull down   
It fell directly to the ground  
Was it pointing me to a bloody fate  
Or gravity pulling it under its weight?   
  
A jaunty bird within a tree  
Then turned and smiled right at me,   
And said, "to find your maiden, it's true  
I'd choose to head West, if I were you"   
  
I turned upon my old boot heel  
I heard from him another squeal    
"Although I must append one fact,   
I've got no clue just where she's at"   
  
I took a second to take stock  
I took a seat upon a rock   
Ignoring the bird within his nest  
I wonder if I should go East or go West?
