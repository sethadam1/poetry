# The Thief (Poem 48)

"Hey there, thief, come back, I say!" he yelled as he followed after  
He'd been accosted, relieved of wallet, by a money snatcher.  
Just then, from above, it's said, a piano fell to ground  
It landed on the gentleman, with a cacophonous sound.   
  
The thief turned back to check things out, the piano lift had been botched  
And while the crowd was gasping, he looped back to steal his watch   
But now the gentleman is dead, left squash-ed down below   
And who was the thief who took his stuff? I guess we'll never know.
