# Huntin' Buddy (Poem 44)   
#### May 4, 2021                                         
        
Perhaps you've yet to hear  
Of my `ol friend, Justin Paneer  
Who shot himself a deer  
Then stopped to drink a beer.   
  
Claimed he'd shot it in the head  
And the hide was dyed blood red  
Or so `ol Justin said  
But I'm sure it's true, 'cuz it's dead  
  
He said the kill was clean  
That the buck was next to a stream  
He described it to the team,   
"A perfect kill - the dream"  
  
But his pals did not agree  
And told `ol Justin, you see  
And despite his story, his plea  
They said that his shots numbered three  
  
So it seemed he was caught in a lie  
And he argued with what they had spied  
They didn't agree, though he tried  
Said a single shot had been fired  
  
The arguing slowly got madder  
Tenor rose like a man on a ladder  
As the tone of the group was in tatters  
A fight broke out and they scattered  
  
Then Justin, the hunter, the ace  
Called his hunting mates a disgrace  
And in that high stress space  
An angry one shot Justin's face  
  
Now Justin, the hunter, he bled  
Felt the buckshot throughout his head  
He's lucky he isn't dead  
But is still confined to his bed  
  
So I bet I know what you're thinking  
I can guess which dots you're linking   
Don't combine hunting with too much drinking  
You can't see me, but I'm winking  
  
Now I'm not saying hunting is bad  
I'm a meat eater, so I am glad  
But if you drink while hunting a stag  
Make certain your friends don't get mad.
