# Bleu Cheese Wedge (Poem 43)   
#### May 3, 2021                                       
      
Treading closer to the edge  
I arranged my bleu cheese wedge  
Guessing, as knife cut to plate,  
How the dressing might taste great  
  
Some might even find it comic  
How I've drown it in balsamic  
I'd ignore their taunts and mumbles  
Gently scooping up the crumbles   
  
Bend it open like a futon   
Stab through lettuce and a crouton  
Lifted gently, skill and grace,  
Fork delivers food to face  
  
Pleasing, perfect, on the palate.   
Don't agree? Well, that's invalid.   
Hope that you've enjoyed this ballad  
Hats off to the bleu cheese salad.
