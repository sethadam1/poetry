# Eduardo Huerte of the Grain Mill (Poem 20)   
#### March 14, 2021     
    
Eduardo Huerte, on his break, had had his coffee fill  
and after rinsing out his cup, went back to work at the mill:  
Grinding, crushing, mixing, mushing, mashing corn and wheat  
Tired, aching, bruising, breaking, so that folks could eat.  
O if it were half past five then he could leave the dome,  
Climb into his Chevrolet and drive the way back home.  
The sun would often just come up and light the tarmac road,  
And he would pass a hundred trucks that tugged their hefty load.  
And often he’d arrive in time to see his children leave  
To catch the bus to school each day so they could learn to read.  
They honestly believed their dad, from ten to half past five,  
Was doing godly work and even changing people’s lives.  
Eduardo, though, was just a man who slaved within a mill  
Who toiled through spring, through summer heat, through snow and autumn chill.  
The kids, well, bless their naive hearts, were not so far from right  
Cause poor Eduardo shed his sweat most every single night,  
And will each eve from now until his frail body’s dead,  
So you and I can stop and buy and eat a loaf of bread.
