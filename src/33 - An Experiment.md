# An Experiment in Trochaic Heptameter (Poem 33)  
#### April 12, 2021                     
      
> This poem was labeled, in my computer, “An Experiment in Trochaic Heptameter.” The pattern is a 14-syllable line like /— /— /— /— /— /— /—, such as Edgar Allen Poe’s The Raven. That description was probably little overly generous, since several of the lines have an extra syllable or an extra rest. Nonetheless, it turns out that 23 years later, the content is eerily relevant.   
  
I can see the faces of the men who walk the border  
Thinking bout their family’s safety, keeping law and order  
Foot in front of foot, they pace, o’er dirt and field and flower  
Shiny shield upon their breast that shows they’ve been empowered  
“Any man should cross the line, for sure they’d be a goner.   
For my country,” they might think, “I’d kill, it’d be an honor.”   
  
On the other side there stands a man who thinks its violent  
Couldn’t wait another day, and wouldn’t just keep silent  
Faced with choice, he chose his voice, he knew of the allure   
Take a chance, and do his best to keep them all secure   
Try to cross, and try to pass, and pray to find a way in  
bring his wife and kids and make life better than it had been.  
Live and love and learn and earn to feed and gain and prosper  
living out the dream they know and heard about and strove for  
“Put my children in a place where their life will exceed mine.   
Give them opportunities so they’re not on the sideline.  
Safety, health, and education, priorities aligned   
Lay the ground for them to have good fortune by design”  
  
Late that night by waterside, the family stood a’shiver  
After hiking miles reached the bending of the river   
Daughters first, the mother next, the father was behind  
It only took them minutes, maybe seven all combined  
Daughters climbed the muddy bank, and soon they counted four  
Had crossed the rushing water and had made it safe ashore  
“Lo hemos hecho!” said the eldest girl, her voice sang out  
She felt it first, but all knew soon, four rifle shots rang out.  
  
Every night they pace the line in quiet introspection  
Knowing they're ensuring our great nation’s close protection.
