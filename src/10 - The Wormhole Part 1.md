# The Wormhole: Part 1 (Poem 10)  
#### March 9, 2021 

> I decided that, within my collection poems, I’d write one long epic poem – a continuing adventure. Although the first bits of the poem date to the late 1990's, I've decided I might continue it. I’m not certain how many parts there will be, or if it will ever truly end. Nevertheless, here is Part One of “The Wormhole.”   
  
Alerted by the thunder crack,  
my concentration snapping back,  
we plotted ourselves way off track  
and sketched a desperate route  
  
Just then, we felt the jet stream blow  
and jostled by the current flow  
our craft began to drop below  
we’d have to bail out  
  
The panel showed us back on course  
but we could feel a different force  
it drew us to its rumbling source  
from top of head to boot  
  
The auto-pilot failed then,  
we reassumed control again  
we straightened out, a certain zen,  
I stowed my parachute.  
  
I said to my subordinate  
“Recite our new coordinate”  
our altitude inordinate,  
it made no type of sense.  
  
The instruments our panel bore  
were contradicting at the core  
we’d never seen them fail before  
we should have then ejected  
  
We felt our craft just then descend,  
it pulled convex from end to end  
it shook and flashed and flexed to bend  
then bang! … our craft corrected.  
  
A moment passed without a sound  
We floated gently, tightly bound,  
a million miles off the ground  
we perched upon a cloud  
  
So in our tube of shiny steel  
a moment passed that felt surreal  
A radar blip then broke the seal  
and everything grew loud  
  
The crew collected readily  
Approached the cockpit headily  
The bridge was lowered steadily  
The crew was then sent aft.  
  
A moment, first, of reckoning  
We saw him soon, unthreatening,  
Inside a dinghy, beckoning  
To join him in his raft.
