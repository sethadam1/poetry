# Majestic Silver Bird (Poem 36)  
#### April 20, 2021                           
            
Above the clouds, I thought I spied  
A silver bird that caught my eye  
He winked at me - or maybe tried   
The two of us locked eyes  
  
A friendly gaze, not misconstrued   
An almost nod, like "hey there, dude"  
A smile we exchanged, 'tis true,  
Concluded this surprise  
  
Reflecting on this brief exchange  
Across a quarter mile range  
Felt honest, not a little strange  
And truly made my day  
  
Nature's creatures forged a bond  
A brief wave of God's magic wand  
He circled o'er a nearby pond  
Then turned and flew my way  
  
He ventured closer, my new friend  
To test our trust, to make amends,   
This beauty never seemed to end  
A moment of pure grace  
  
I tried again, to catch his eye  
To watch that bird's majestic flight   
I then looked up to wave goodbye  
I felt it hit my face   
  
That asshole bird sprayed me with shit  
I wiped my face and gagged and spit  
I grabbed a rock to throw at it  
Straight up into the air   
  
The silver streak then flew away  
I lost the stone in a sunlight ray  
The rock then hit me, "fuck this day!"  
I mumbled in despair   
  
That night I lay there, in my bed  
A goddamned bump upon my head  
"I hate dumb birds" I might've said  
But no one said a peep   
  
Then came a tap at the window bay  
That silver bird, as if to say,     
"Fuck you," he winked, then flew away  
...so screw it, I went to sleep
