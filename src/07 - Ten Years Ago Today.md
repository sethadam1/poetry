# Ten Years Ago Today (Poem 7)  
#### March 8, 2021   
  
A scorching day in late July  
Had left me wondering just why  
We choose that day, the knot, to tie  
But it worked out okay  
10 years ago today  
  
The forecast called for post-noon rain  
And the humidity sustained  
But we took the chance and drank champagne  
and the clouds remained away  
10 years ago today  
  
Our families traveled from the north  
St Louis, Chicago, Miami, so forth,  
And some came down I-10, of course  
To join in our soiree  
10 years ago today  
  
We sweat the details, last minute change  
The wedding planner rearranged,  
“Deep breath, all weddings are this strange”  
I heard somebody say  
10 years ago today  
  
Move chairs inside? Or risk getting wet?  
Did the cake arrive? Are we all set?  
And the strawberry soup — who could forget?  
But the party went on anyway  
10 years ago today  
  
A decade later, I’m sitting here  
Reflecting on the past ten years  
We’ve had more smiles than we’ve had tears  
Not bad a resume!  
10 years ago today  
  
“I love you! I love you! I love you!” I’ll yell  
A public announcement, for others as well  
Even posting on Facebook… exposing myself  
Still because of vows we made  
10 years ago today  
  
To many our life’s a boring one  
But I think we have plenty of fun  
Just me and you, my honeybun  
And that’s your sobriquet,  
In our own special matinee,  
That’s currently underway,  
And began this very day:  
10 years ago today
