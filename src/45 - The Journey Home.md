# The Journey Home (Poem 45)

Three steps back, I sensed the man coming round the bend  
Saw the shadow first and thought "wonder how this ends?"   
Nonetheless I turned the corner, 'specting to go straight  
Smashed directly into him, guess that was my fate  
  
Carrying a laptop, that man had a healthy grip  
Even though we banged a'front, the laptop didn't slip  
I had left my laptop home, but for goodness' sake,   
of all the days to go to the bakery and carry home a cake...
