# A Calypso from the Kitchen (Poem 41)    
#### April 27, 2021                                   
  
The other day I ordered fancy chicken cordon bleu  
And when it came to table it was steaming through and through   
It smelled delicious, looked amazing, pleasing to the eye  
But when I took a bite I found the taste was somewhat dry   
  
I motioned to the waiter so that I could, this, explain   
I told him that I didn't really want to be a pain  
As he leaned I said to him, "My problem - was it, Jeff?  
I cannot lie, this chicken's dry, would you please tell the chef?"   
  
The chef came out, looked at the plate, and said, "this looks just fine"  
I gently told him "But it's dry" and had a sip of wine  
"You're wrong," said he, "it's just right and it has a perfect smell"    
I took another look and gently offered, "Go to hell."    
  
.  
  
When I woke up on Saturday I noticed something wrong  
Where normally my hand would be the arm had gotten long  
By Sunday it had morphed itself to round, like a balloon  
By Monday it was clear that I had grown myself a spoon  
  
By Thursday I was wondering how I might live my life  
Because my foot had slowly changed from curly toes to knives  
I got so nervous when I saw my right hand had turned red     
So I was almost thankful when it was a fork instead  
  
The weekend came and that was when I shrugged and had to cry  
Because I'd grown a pepper mill where used to be my eye  
Can I attempt a remedy by drinking an elixir?   
Before my kneecap, overnight, becomes a standing mixer?   
  
So there stood I with one good eye, a mixer on my knee  
A fork and knife to cut my steak, a spoon to stir my tea  
A little dash of pepper squeezed from underneath my eye  
And watched my shoulder turn into a rolling pin for pie    
  
And so it seems that time I told the chef to go to hell  
It really was a witch who put me underneath a spell  
"If given that chance once again I'd simply eat my chicken"   
I whispered from the cabinet, for now I am a kitchen.
