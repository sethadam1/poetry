# The Business Squirrel (Poem 39)

One morning I went to my car, I'd parked it 'round the street
And walked up to discover it was moved up thirty feet

I scratched my head as if to say "I wonder what transpired,
Did I go out and drive last night? Or maybe I'm just tired?"

But as I got a few steps nearer, wasn't quite as far
A squirrel, sitting driver's seat, was startled in my car

A moment's pause for me, it was, to ponder what I saw
And that was when he rolled the window down and waved his paw.

"Good sir, I'm sorry for surprise I didn't mean for sorrow,
I had to take a meeting and needed this, to borrow."

I looked around confusedly to process this here sight
Although I must admit the squirrel awfully was polite

He loosened up a tie that wrapped his neck then cracked his spine
I saw him change the radio from his channel to mine

He took his hat from the other seat and placed it on his head
A tiny briefcase by his side, a scarf as thin as thread

The door, it swung right open and he hopped down on the ground
His tiny little paw prints barely even made a sound

He gave a little bow to me then said "Thanks, one more time"
Then scurried off, away, and up a tree I watched him climb

I really can't say that I mind this moment came to pass
I only wish that squirrel left some money for the gas.
