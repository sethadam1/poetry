# Sonnet 4 (Poem 14)  
#### March 11, 2021

Her words reveal a calculated tease,  
Suggestive ever slightly, they remain  
A tapestry of tones designed to please  
But masked as common conversation, plain.  
When first acquainted wondered, ever since,  
For gentlemen cannot help wonder if  
There lay a lady waiting for her prince  
Beneath the smile and the quicker wit.  
Perhaps the time is right for paths to cross?  
Though wishful thinking brings men to the edge.  
Tis better to have known than to have lost?â€™  
He wondered as he tiptoed to the ledge  
Though warned a trying battle is surmised,  
The knight knows that in time, he claims his prize.
