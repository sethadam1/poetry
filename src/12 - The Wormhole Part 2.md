#### March 10, 2021

I took my first mate, stepping down,  
Both careful not to slip and drown  
Into the sea of rusty brown  
Within which our ship rocked.  
  
We crossed the bridge of our own ship  
The dinghy, at an increased clip,  
Touched stern for us to enter it  
Then latched upon us, docked.  
  
The creature offered up his hand  
Its texture like a hardened sand  
Wrapped tightly in a gauze-like band  
Extended for my grasp.  
  
I bravely reached and, contact made,  
Was helped across and then he bade  
I sit, which I did, unafraid,  
I buckled up the clasp.  
  
My first mate, too, was helped aboard,  
The creature’s steady hand implored  
A solid seat was his reward  
He fastened in as well.  
  
The creature then resumed his post  
A silent, yet a focused host  
Approaching soon, a sort of coast  
Alerted by a bell.  
  
The dinghy soon was marshaled in  
What looked to be our captain’s twin  
Had waved us through, we journeymen  
Were welcomed in the fog.  
  
A silent guide approaching me  
Took what I’d call “delivery”  
Of me and my first mate and we  
Were ushered through the bog.  
  
Then out of what I’d call a “smoke”  
A palace that before was cloaked  
Appeared when a chant was invoked  
And we approached the door.  
  
The journey that we navigate  
Had led us to this fancy gate  
Our guide rapped twice to indicate  
That our small ship had landed.  
  
A doorman drew the entry wide  
Our guide politely stepped aside  
He indicated “Step inside”  
An audience was granted.
