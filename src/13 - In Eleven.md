# In Eleven (Poem 13)  
#### March 10, 2021

>I’m a big fan of progressive music, bands like Rush, Dream Theater, Yes, Haken, Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree fame), and many more. One of the key components of prog rock is the use of odd time signatures, like 7/4 or 13/8. I started to wonder what it would feel like to write a poem in a strange cadence. In poetry, this is called meter.   
  
>Here’s the result of writing in eleven, which resulted in what I’ve since learned is called hypercatalectic poetry. Though the lines are reliably iambic - the repeated accent patterns are "da DUM da DUM" - the feet themselves have an extra syllable. We're used to 10-syllable iambic pentameter, these 11-syllable lines are called hendecasyllables. In true prog form, we change time signatures, so my final couplet is in standard, 10-beat iambic pentameter - five da DUMs per line - just to keep you on your... feet.   
    
> I really like this one for the way it sounds. But I can acknowledge that it's definitely not great poetry. The simple connection of color to emotion, the meandering from a poem about art to one about color. I think it stands more successfully as an experiment with meter than a good poem.   
  
I wonder could be a poem be written, in time,  
Whose rhythm, in eleven, doesn’t feel right?  
And if read by a stranger when presented  
Would they regret that which they had consented?  
  
I’d argue art is like a magic potion  
Its power in evoking an emotion  
The artist, with his color and depiction,  
Can cobble up a feeling, born of fiction.  
  
If art is, just in fact, a fancy math dance  
With color, words, and sights serving to advance  
A narrative or to evoke a feeling,  
I wonder could a writer leave you reeling?  
Their goal is to manipulate your heart strings  
With words designed to make you see and feel things?  
  
The meter in the line is less important -  
Yes, even if the final couplet's shortened.   
With just a stanza and a color palette,  
About as subtle as a rubber mallet.   
  
A flushing pink indicative of aching,  
A black and purple heart inside is breaking,  
Be green with envy; red with anger, fuming;  
Or bluish sick, with sadness all-consuming;  
A haunted, disengaging white is thoughtless;  
An orange glow; a sickly, yellow jaundice.  
  
That painting of emotion from the start?   
Creators have this power through their art.
