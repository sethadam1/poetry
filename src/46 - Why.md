# Why? (Poem 46)
#### May 6, 2021                                           
          
Friends, it's time I shared with you  
The reason why my tongue is blue  
I'm not kidding, this is no joke  
I've got plenty of air, I haven't choked  

I'm not too cold, I don't have chills  
I'm all paid up on oxygen bills  
I haven't been stung by a hive of bees  
I'm not afflicted with a rare disease   

It wasn't a popsicle, it's not a drink  
It isn't close to what you think   
It's not a candy, gum, or food  
You're on the wrong track, not to be rude  

Have you got a guess? Or don't you know  
Why my red tongue's now indigo?  
I haven't tried to mislead you -  
But look above, the light bulb's blue.
