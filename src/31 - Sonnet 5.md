# Sonnet 5 (Poem 31)  
#### April 5, 2021                 
  
From January first itâ€™s hard to see  
whatever lays before us, far or near.  
Designing different fates, but what will be  
will be despite resolving else this year.  
The clouds that cloud the vision in my mind  
cannot contain the sunlight rays that band  
together, shining promises I find  
give comfort as she holds me by the hand.  
So while we wander round this endless rhyme,  
and searching for a meaning to it all,  
I find that I can face the plain of time  
if she is there to catch me when I fall.  
The plan to play an ever-growing part,  
made easier when cradled by the heart.
