# The Beauty Within (Poem 3)
#### March 8, 2021

A rose is has its petals, the sweet docile scent  
The feeling that leaves us so perfectly bent  
But only the petals, around which light glows,  
Are what we admire when we smell a rose.   
  
The irony, most certainly, said through a grin:  
the scent emanates from the bud found within.  
so that which we use as a symbol of love  
is only a coating, a cover, a glove.  
  
Those deep bold red petals that smile at the sky  
Or rest in the vase for a wandering eye  
Are nothing but dust-covers, hiding inside  
the light, soft aroma we all recognize.   
  
So next time you feel that your surface is tough  
Your body too strange or your face is too rough  
Remember the roses: tipped gently in the wind  
and its secret, few know, is the beauty within.
