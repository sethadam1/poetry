# Sixty Days (Poem 17)  
#### January 22, 2003   
  
> This was written in January of 2003, exactly 60 days before I moved to Florida.  
 
In 60 days the sun will shine, the bitter cold here, left behind  
I rearrange my daily parts – a chapter ends, a new one starts  
  
Who knows what tales lay ahead as I move on, down there, instead  
I slowly filter out my cruft to organize and pack my stuff.  
  
“I love this place” I said I learned, a gentle red of light sunburn  
Let’s see what future dreaming buys, what chances here materialize.   
  
An afternoon, but not too late, with warming air that circulates  
and cools the gentle forehead sweat and proves to me, suspicion yet.   
  
A different sort of life to lead, a different sort of smile you need,  
"Don’t sit back and observe the tale – stand up, take charge, try not to fail."  
  
So 60 days must slowly burn, and 60 nights I’ll toss and turn  
I can’t fast forward the calendar run, so I’ll cross them off here, one by one.
