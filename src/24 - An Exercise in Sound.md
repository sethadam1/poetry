# An Exercise in Sound (Poem 24) 
#### March 22, 2021   
  
> I admit, this one is mostly pointless other than the fact that it's fun sounding. That's it - a poem written solely to be interesting to hear. But what's great about it, that I'd long forgotten but re-found upon reading, is that there's a rhyming scheme. The first couplet (the first two lines) rhyme with the last two lines, the second couplet rhymes with the penultimate couplet, etc. 

> Also, how timely that the playful, sing-song rhyming evokes Dr. Seuss.  

rough and ready rugby red  
tossed and tiny tricky tread  
lefthand lawyer leaves lost light  
tiny ‘taters treat too tight  
soggy sasquatch seeking soul  
mad mime’s mom meets mighty mole  
sidestep sing slept slingshot snow  
bar bust bamboo bellow beau  
crack cream crow cries cruel crew crate  
tiny tim tells tom to wait  
six sex sax sings sam’s sixth socks  
char chew chalice chuckle chalks  
fat fix farther fill for free  
think thought this that thing though three  
tick tock time ticks thick track true  
drip drop drink drool drought dream drew  
swinger swishy swiper swoon   
raptor reading red raccoon   
lick lock lollypop laquer lap  
sneeze snot snicker sniff snooze snap  
yapping yet yarn yin yang yap  
ringer rinsing wringing wrap   
bunting bacon big bassoon  
napkin naughty nine, not noon    
flicker fandom fringe fun flue  
quicker quints quit quilting queue  
glueing grape goo gallop glee  
carport can call canopy   
robot roommate ranking rocks  
tophat tinkers travel talks  
apex aviary eight  
gabber golfball garden gate  
slot slick slalom slinky slow  
grip grasp greater grieve grass grow  
catcall crawfish cancer coal  
bring back barter boiling bowl  
prickly pears peak piny plight  
never know not nibble knight  
dill do dollop drip drop dead  
wing walk wicker well worth wed
