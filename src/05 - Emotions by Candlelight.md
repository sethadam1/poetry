# Emotions by Candlelight (Poem 5)  
#### March 8, 2021  
  
I’m sitting at the table basked  
in flick’ring candle light  
The space I feel between us  
likes to haunt me in the night  
I try to wipe her from my mind  
And yet, try as I might….  
  
A future seems to beckon me –  
it lures me toward its glow  
It’s wrinkled finger taunting me  
and bending ever slow  
He laughs because he sees my fate  
and I will never know…  
  
I wonder will we ever be  
the way we thought we were?  
Will I ever feel my heart,  
again, begin to stir?  
I wonder will I ever feel  
the way I felt with her?
