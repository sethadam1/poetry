# Hey again! (Poem 54)  
#### August 17, 2022   
  
> The thing that always bothered me about the poem "<a href="https://github.com/sethadam1/poetry/blob/main/src/09%20-%20Hey.md">Hey!</a>" is that it's just random. I look back and wish that the one line verse rhymed with "one," the two line verse rhymed with "two," and so on. I don't think this is a particular great poem, but it is different than my normal sing-songy iambics and it was a challenge for me to write.  

Feel the rays of the warm, red sun  
Hey!  
  
Ever swam in ocean blue  
Felt the seaweed pulling you?  
Hey hey!  
  
Once I felt so very free  
Sitting underneath a tree   
Tapped a rhythm on my knee  
Hey hey hey!  
  
I went to a grocery store  
Walked through their electric door  
Almost slipped on a sticky floor   
Felt my pants split as they tore   
Hey hey hey hey!  
  
Just as guests began to arrive  
From afar I spotted the hive  
Bees came fast, like a line drive  
Stung like mad we may not survive!  
Shortly after, though, revived  
Hey hey hey hey hey!  
  
Once I had a load of bricks  
Destined for a wall I'd fix  
Started with the grout I'd mix  
Laid a brick and stood transfixed  
Then I took a break, for kicks  
Hey man, that's just politics  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey!   
  
Then, deep inside my bag of tricks  
I pulled out two ivory chopsticks  
Mimicked movement, heard two clicks  
I coated the ends with two broad licks  
Then as if in mind, I was sick   
I poked my eye, like a lunatic  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey!  
  
This may sound a bit contrived  
A tale from my mental archive   
It's running Windows 95  
So wild stories often thrive  
Before you offer a high five  
Hey hey hey hey hey!  
  
Thinking back to just before  
You took and nap, began to snore  
I stubbed my toe, let out a roar  
And thus we had a shouting war  
Hey hey hey hey!  
  
I calmed myself and drank some tea  
You had a glass of warm chablis  
We swept aside some old debris  
Hey hey hey!  
  
I chomped upon a fresh cashew  
Enjoyed a bowl of cheese fondue  
Hey hey!  
  
Is this concept overdone?   
Hey!
