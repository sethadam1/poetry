# An Explanation (Poem 37)

A band of sunlight struck my face and stirred me from a slumber  
I slowly woke and thanked the sun for the blanket I'd slept under  
I listed to the noise around, absorbing Nature's chorus  
Appreciating time well spent just napping near a forest   
  
The warm red sun had left my body tingling to the toe   
I felt a gentle tugging from my knees and down below,    
And just that moment as I felt an itch within my pants  
I noted that my body had been covered up by ants  
  
So just as you'd imagine I attempt to rise and flee  
I paused just as I realized I was just beneath a bee  
But as my shoulder lifted and I tried to rock above  
I realized that they'd wrapped me up quite tightly, like a glove  
  
The first of many ants that moved within a long straight line  
Came ever closer just until his bulgy eyes met mine  
Upon his little head he had a sign that seemed to read  
"We want some gatorade, my friend, and a bag of pumpkin seeds."   
  
This strange request caught me off guard, but patiently he waited  
Until I understood and all my struggling abated  
"Some pumpkin seeds to eat, I see, a Gatorade as beverage"  
Seemed easy to procure for me, and well, they had the leverage  
  
I said I would agree to go and get for them this meal  
If they, in turn, would loosen binds, just that was my appeal  
The leader ant admonished me, or so that's what I thought  
If I did not return, he signed, in time, I would be caught  
  
They'd sneak into my window and while I was resting there  
They'd burrow in my earholes and they'd pull out all my hair  
The bugs would chew my fingers and the ants would chew my toes  
The bee would hunt me down and he would sting me on the nose  
  
They slowly unhooked all the sticks and stones that held me down   
I gently hiked and limped my way back into this here town   
My pockets held no money but I had a meal to cater  
I knew that I could procure snacks, and come back to pay later    
  
In fact I'm on my way to feed the ants, and bugs, and a bee  
So officer, that why I had to steal these snacks, you see?
