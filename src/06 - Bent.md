# Bent (Poem 6)  
#### March 8, 2021   
  
Like a diver returned from the deepest depths  
or an elbow on the dinner table,  
I am bent when I’m not in your presence  
Hurt without sight of your smile.  
  
None before left me feeling a feeling like this  
All of them came and then slowly went  
None have left me so lovesick I’m crippled  
None have left me so hanging I’m bent  
  
A kiss can’t make palpable longing  
A rose can communicate little  
Look carefully out of your perfect brown eyes  
and you’ll see that I’m bent at the middle.  
  
Divided, but close, through the white clouded glass  
I can sense that you know what I meant  
As I gently confess that I love you  
I’m so tortured without you I’m bent.
