# This is Halloween (Poem 53)
#### October 21, 2021
   
It's pumpkin season, once again  
It's Fall we're back in month number ten  
As we bring down our autumn rakes    
Take just a moment, we must make  
Our trick or treating evening plans   
Our gourd spiced lattes in our hands  
We'll plan our route right, if we could  
And canvas this whole neighborhood.   
  
House one we stopped there just for kicks  
I know they'll give me a fun-sized Twix  
House two we skip, because it's quicker  
And they're prob'ly handing out small Snickers  
House three, they're old and it's amazin'  
They're still going with a box of raisins  
But house four is where we aim for the stars -   
They always have the full-size bars!   
  
At quarter-ten we're home and ready  
Unloading candy quick and steady  
Peel off costumes from our tour   
Pouring candy, straight on the floor  
We analyze our candy raid  
And scope the items we aim to trade.   
  
Swedish Fish? Yes, please and thank you.   
Milk duds: keeping, that's a miscue.   
Want my Good and Plenty? Cheers!   
I'll just take 3 Musketeers.   
Playing defense with the grown ups  
Stealing all our Reese's Cups.   
  
Wonder what the adults mean  
When they say that Halloween  
Isn't for them anymore...   
Then who's the leftover candy for?
