Know what would be cool?   
Install a swimming pool.   
A dog that doesn't drool.    
A back for this, here, stool.   
  
Know what would be cool?  
A silly dancing ghoul  
A back massaging tool.   
To find a fancy jewel.   
  
Know what would be cool?   
A trip to Istanbul.  
To live by the golden rule.   
A four day week at school.  
  
Know what would be cool?   
A really friendly mule.  
To gather round the yule.   
To know how to use a slide rule.   
   
Know what would be cool?   
Fancy thread on a spool.   
Water guns at a dual.  
Also, having, like, a lot of money.
