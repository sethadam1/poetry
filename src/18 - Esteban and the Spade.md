# Esteban and the Spade (Poem 18)
#### March 13, 2021 

> I wrote this poem in 1996 or so, and I think I hate it. First off, I’m not confident if this is even how I feel about the modern world. Ignore the fact that the twist is total bullshit, the moral is ridiculous. But I give a freshman credit for trying to make sense of a confusing, post-modern, industrial world he was soon to enter.  

> Secondly, I don’t know why the protagonist is named Esteban. I have several poems from that era that reference a Spanish immigrant and his plight. Clearly, there was some misunderstanding - or maybe sympathy - for immigrants who I likely recognized were working far harder than many Americans born into privilege, so many of these poems contrast their sacrifices with white males (see: [Samjuan](https://github.com/sethadam1/poetry/blob/main/src/11%20-%20Samjuan.md), several more in the pipeline).     
> Third, the mention of [Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) is confusing to me. Maybe it was an in-class prompt? Not sure how an 18th century, pre-Enlightenment philosopher would land in ay of my poems. I'm sure there was a reason, but I don't know why. I have to imagine it connects to this quote from his theory of human nature: "The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is mine', and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society.."    

> Either way, here’s the original, unaltered.   
  
He digs, through day and night,  
planting his own food, to feed his family.  
He doesn’t need us – not for anything, he says.  
“Your smoky cities and loud machines, your gas guzzling cars, your TV and video games, your cash machines. I can do it all here, with a few animals and nature.”  
  
A fire, a stream, the trees, and the land  
seem to alleviate the need for society.  
Secluded? “Yes.”  
Peaceful? “Incredibly.”  
Uncorrupted? “Totally.”  
What might Rousseau say?  
  
Esteban digs with a shiny steel spade,  
He didn’t make it, but he depends upon it.  
To dig, to make holes, to plant his food, to feed his family,  
To make irrigation passages that protect him from wrathful nature  
and refresh his crops, even in droughts.  
But he didn’t make it.  
So…  
  
Secluded? “Hmm…maybe not.”  
Peaceful? “Still incredibly..but who knows for how long.”  
Uncorrupted? No, in fact, he needs us more than we need him:  
Because he needs his spade.
