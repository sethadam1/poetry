# Hey! (Poem 9)  
#### March 8, 2021   
  
> Another experiment. Note the length of the stanzas. This is me pushing myself outside my comfort zone. It's pure coincidence that this is called "hey!*" and I originally published this on a platform called "HEY World!", but this was written almost 20 years prior to this publication.   
  
Feel the rays of the warm, red sun  
*Hey!*  
  
Stop and look at Nature’s laws  
It’ll leave you with a pause  
*Hey hey!*  
  
Ever been to oceanside  
Swimming in the harsh riptide  
Couldn’t swim out if you tried?  
*Hey hey hey!*
  
Have you ever spent an hour  
Doting on a broccoli flower?  
Or a jalapeño’s power?  
Or a lemon’s juice, so sour?   
*Hey hey hey hey!*  
  
I gently placed a piece of cheese  
Upon the tips of the caps of my knees  
Waited for the slightest breeze  
to send the enchanting scent to the bees  
And fed them tiny bits as a tease  
*Hey hey hey hey hey!*  
  
Have you ever stopped a crowd  
Glaring at a puffy cloud  
that left you struck, and truly wowed  
So just then you announced aloud  
That on that very day you vowed  
That would make your parents proud?  
*Hey hey hey hey hey hey!*  
  
Have you ever felt the sting  
Of a heavy pinky ring  
That maybe, just, could pass for bling  
That caught a hair as if to cling  
and made you question everything?  
*Hey hey hey hey hey!*  
  
Once I stubbed my second toe  
On a table leg below  
Swore I heard a laugh from a crow  
I named that bird “Pistachio”  
*Hey hey hey hey!*  
  
Half and half is still half fat  
Said the Chinese diplomat  
We adjust the thermostat  
*Hey hey hey!*  
  
Wonder if I’d like this book  
Picked it up to take a look  
*Hey hey!*  
  
Are you still there, anyone?   
*Hey!*
