You drank from the carton  
and toed through the tide,  
reclining the seat back,  
enjoying the ride.  
  
A pinball was jagged,  
as Bonemarrow spied,  
and sandpaper napkins  
were what Jeffrey tried.  
  
And ever so slightly,  
as Sandy Jo pried,  
the turnip was rolling  
and catching a stride.  
  
Deb’s always the bridesmaid   
and never the bride  
So there she lays pond’ring  
her own suicide.  
  
Her passion, she’s finding,  
she now can confide,  
is bathing in vats of   
cool formaldehyde.  
  
It’s not so much flying  
as much as a glide –  
All these green tomatoes  
are half-baked, not fried.  
  
Yet there, in a zip top,  
the leaves had been dried  
and friends of the party  
were stuck on the slide  
  
Seems Katie, not Booker,   
will serve as the guide,   
since sweet cousin Lizzy  
has never applied.  
  
The rules penned by Justin  
were meant to abide  
the by-laws by Preston  
and, yet, were denied.  
  
He said “Glass champagne flutes  
were not made to hide!”  
Yet, beneath crates of yam paste,  
young Allison died.  
  
So Frederick and Patrick   
and his nephew Clyde,  
though old Colonel Bonemarrow’d  
yet to decide,  
  
Convened at a picnic  
and sat oceanside  
And cheers’d to the sun god  
admiring the tide.
