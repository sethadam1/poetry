# Sonnet 6 (Poem 32)   
#### April 8, 2021                   
    
> At least so far, this is the last of my sonnets. Why did I write sonnets? Was it the strict form? Or the fact that Shakespeare wrote them? The world may never know.    
  
“It just was words” she told herself at first.  
“I like this girl” he thought as he replied.  
But something left them both with unquenched thirst  
and hearts both beating, strangely satisfied.  
What started as an often brief exchange  
turned quickly to intense, and like a glove  
that perfectly fits, snapping right in place,  
suggested whims and flavors of new love.  
Distracted from the day, she sat and smiled.  
His fingers danced a message on the keys,  
his brain was dancing boundless – true and wild,  
he pictured her, intently aimed to please.  
The contents on their words, a kind of art,  
they delicately had each other’s heart.
