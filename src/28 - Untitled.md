# Untitled (Poem 28)

> In Greek mythology, Eros is the god of love, and Thanatos is the god of death, making them opposite of one another. The story of Eros and Thanatos inspired Sigmund Freud to create a psychological theory that a person’s instincts fall into one of two categories: the Eros category or the Thanatos category. I must have read about that before writing this.   
  
> I remember this poem being from my junior year of college, so Fall 1996 or Spring 1997.   
  
Thanatos and Eros stand  
On my opposite sides, in my opposite hands  
Tugging my body, a grand design  
Frequently leaving me caught in a bind.  
  
Thanatos often prevails at start  
Eros responds by appealing to heart  
Like weighted scales that tip, I find,  
Frequently leaving me caught in a bind.  
  
Love, I feel, will triumph but  
Still, the darkness is a crutch  
Pulling me down when I’m behind  
Frequently leaving me caught in a bind.  
  
Anger, violence, pain, aggression  
Easier than love's expression  
But forever are entwined  
Frequently leaving me caught in a bind.
