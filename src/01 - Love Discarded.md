# Love, Discarded (Poem 1)
### March 5, 2021

I sometimes wonder all about the garbage cans at schools
The trash composed of written prose, the love letters of fools

Emotions bold, their heart and soul, poured onto paper, scrawled
But either killed, abandoned still, before received at all.

A person once took days or months, then shaking, lips a’quiver
Allowed to pass, alack, alas, to never be delivered

And so within these rubbish bins lays someone’s wish transpired
Emotions bared, but never shared… despite their once desire.
