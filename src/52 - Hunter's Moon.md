The night is calm and deadly black  
The tenth month once again is back   
October chill and harvest night  
The empty dusk, a spooky fright 

And two weeks hence, so very soon   
The bloody mark of a hunter's moon   
Shall shine upon us, that pale red  
Mark Hallow's Eve, and raise the dead   

Whilst I walking down the street   
Twixt shuttered houses 'round fields of wheat  
I heard a crackling and spun right round  
And paused to analyze the sound  

A low-voice grumbled, a hand, a shoe  
Climbed up through dirt, earth split in two  
The head appearing, above the ground  
Just then I heard this horrible sound    

"My undead body feels hunger pains  
Although I'm not a fan of brains  
I call to all, come Witch, come Wiccan,  
I'm seeking all... your spicy chicken."   

I then suspected this might be fake  
I stopped and did a double-take  
I count one zombie, no more no fewer  
And here stands I, a connoisseur  
  
So bravely then, not seeking thrills,    
I offer up, my chicken skills  
I stare directly into its eyes  
And start a story about Popeye's  
  
I tell him of Wendy's and Chik-fil-a   
McDonald's, too, and Raising Cane's  
I tell him of funny and punny store signs  
Of people standing in block-length lines 

I tell him they're sold out of all that they've got  
From Standard to Spicy to Nashville Hot  
I tell him that farmers are weak on their legs  
As they coddle their chickens to lay them more eggs  

I tell him that chickens are packed in a cage  
To satisfy all of this fried chicken rage  
There's no end to this chicken craze    
Perplexed, he says, "I'll just stick with brains."      
  
Then suddenly, he calls to his brothers  
His friends and cousins and fathers and mothers  
I count until just thirty one   
Until I stop, and turn, and run   

And then I find, to my surprise    
It's Halloween and the zombies rise  
I see the zombie apocolypse comin'   
As all of them rise from the dead when they're summon'd   
  
All night they chased us all through the plains  
They came for chicken, but now want brains  
That crispy breading, a dash of salt -   
I should've helped, it's all my fault   
  
The sun is rising, the light now breaks  
And bodies are littered through streets and lakes  
The undead retreat now, back to their tomb  
We'll forever remember this hunter's moon.   
  
A few days later, a friend stopped by   
We thought that lunch would sound all right  
He offered tenders with crispy bread  
I thought "nah, perhaps just a salad instead."
