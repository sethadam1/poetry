Imagination inspiration, molded — just like clay  
I’m trapped in class with eyes of glass on a sunny day in May  
I feel the forces churn inside, a bold medieval play  
The moral’s lost, at any cost. And focused? I can’t say.  
Window-gazing, red eyes glazing, dreaming through the day  
Hopelessly, carelessly, fearlessly, cheerlessly, senselessly wasting away.
