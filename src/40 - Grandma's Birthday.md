# Grandma's Birthday (Poem 40)    
#### April 26, 2021                                 
        
My grandma's birthday's coming soon and family's flying in  
We're gath'ring in her condo for a cookout with our kin  
Aunts Nancy and Sydelle and will just be hanging by the lake  
Til Grandma has to blow out all the candles on her cake  
  
Aunt Jenna got the burgers and my Uncle Harmon cooked  
My cousin Ron stole candy while his brother Maxwell looked  
Aunt Margo brought the Fritos and Aunt Velma brought dessert  
And little cousin Franky fell while running and got hurt  
  
At just about 2:30 Uncle Martin made a sound  
To summon all the family to return and gather 'round  
Then Grandma got wrapped up in song and joined in the adventures,  
She blew out all the candles - but forgot to pull her dentures   
  
I'll ne'er forget the look on Aunty Pat's face, or her husband  
When during "happy birthday" she was hit by a bicuspid   
So now when people ask me what my fear of cake's about  
I try to hide the memory o'when my grandma's teeth blew out
