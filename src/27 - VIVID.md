# VIVID (Poem 27)  
#### March 29, 2021       
      
> Another poem more about the sound than the content. These "sound experiments" are also fun because sometimes, the words chosen for their meter and rhymability still make for strong mental images. The key to effective and fun poetry like this is to make it not just sound good, but also to make it very easy to picture something clearly in your head while you're reading.   
    
> I like to read this one aloud as fast as possible.   
  
a dusty rose  
some cheerios  
a moldy fish  
a firehose  
a county fair  
a gaping stare  
a sunny day  
a broken chair  
a burnt wood match  
an egg that hatched  
a spotty rash  
a camera flash  
a toasted bread  
a kosher pickle  
old green bills  
a silver nickel  
a door that’s stuck  
a goose, a duck  
a crashed up car  
hit by a truck  
a leg of lamb  
a sky-line tram  
say “thank-you, ma’am.”  
a can of spam  
a ski-slope nose  
cold, bluish toes  
a hot spring glacier  
where water flows  
a sock to mend  
a book to lend  
an old best friend  
a cow …… the end.
