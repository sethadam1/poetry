# Season's Greetings (Poem 35)  
#### April 19, 2021                         
          
> In 2017, at the height of the first real worldwide cryptocurrency frenzy, I gave everyone on my team flash drives loaded with Ethereum. While this isn't really part of my "poetry collection," it's still a poem I wrote, so I think it qualifies for inclusion here.    
  
December’s upon us, it’s still sort of funny  
All season discussing this digital money  
Now, some of you b’lieved this investment insane  
To trust in a ledger – the so-called blockchain  
   
Your money, in code, stored right under your nose   
It’s volatile, rising to new highs and lows  
But just as the Festivus season arrives  
I’m gifting you all freshly loaded flash drives  
   
On it, four files that may cause delirium   
Passwords and private keys storing Ethereum  
Safely, securely, please open the folders  
And welcome, my friends… you’re all now crypto-holders!
