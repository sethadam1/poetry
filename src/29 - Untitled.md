# Untitled (Poem 29)

> I so clearly remember poetry class my sophomore year; a student named Ben had written a poem about buildings turning to dust, so I wrote this as a reaction to that poem. I thought it was terrible. He loved it. I still love the idea that "history" is beneath our feet as the old slowly crumbles.    
  
We tread upon history  
The dust: all that remains of past civilizations  
and we care not  
that we continue to destroy it daily.   
  
And we add more  
dust  
rubble  
concrete  
wood  
straw  
And I wonder how long it will be  
before we walk not only on the structures  
but over the trodden memories of humility.
