# Eternally One (Poem 26)  
#### March 24, 2021     
    
You’re so much in me, you bring out my best  
I feel my heart pound through the bones of my chest  
  
We sit ‘cross the table, I stare in your eyes  
I see tears are welling, caught me by surprise  
  
The rift that’s between us; I know we can mend  
Without you, my angel, my whole world is bent  
  
I’m lovesick, I love you…let’s not say we’re done  
Instead face the future: eternally one.
