Josephine and Janice found a fluffy pussy cat  
Josephine reached out to touch it, petting down its back  
The cat purred softly, arching back, and turned itself around  
It rubbed against her leg as she admired the fur, so brown.   
  
Janice said "I bet this cat is not far from its owner.   
Inspect the collar for a tag, and we can try to phone her.  
I bet they're worried sick and, likely sat in high alert  
And it is up to us then return this puss unhurt."   
  
Josephine agreed but sadly no tag was attached  
Leaving both to question what resource could be dispatched.   
Since the cat bore nothing against which facts could be matched,  
the girls began to wonder how a plot could hence be hatched.  
  
Just before a plan could be constructed by the girls  
Debating pros and cons, an awkward moment thus unfurled -   
The cat turned round, and clear as day, it sat, observed, then winked  
And said to Josephine, "Ahem, may I please have a drink?"   
  
The girl sat quiet, both unsure, of what would happen next  
Both silently confused, perplexed, nonplussed, completely vexed  
Then Janice, bravely, said to him, "Excuse me, Cat Who Talks,   
I haven't any water but you can share my juice box."   
  
He took a sip and satisfied, said, "Sorry for the trouble.  
I really should return back home, and do it on the double.   
My owner doesn't know I'm gone, I prob'ly should return,   
If I come home too late each night his attitude's quite stern."  
  
And so the kitten marched away and waved to them, goodbye,  
the girls were scolded by their moms for telling such a lie.  
The next time Jan and Josie saw a cat outside one day  
Without a single word, they turned, and ran the hell away.
