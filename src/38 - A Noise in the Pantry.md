# A Noise in the Pantry (Poem 38)  
#### April 22, 2021                               
      
The noise came from the pantry in the hallway in the back  
I was eating chicken nuggets when I heard a healthy "whack"  
I looked up from my dinner shouting "Anyone hear that?"  
When no response returned, I thought "I bet it was a rat."  
  
So I manufactured armor using Grandma's pots and lids  
And to keep my fingers safe I had our old gray oven mitts  
And the apron that I found that Daddy uses on the grill  
Made the coverage I needed so I moved it for the kill.  
  
When I made it to the hallway there, I knelt down on a knee  
Like a sailor in the navy just returning from the sea,  
I took a deeper breath and then I paused and crossed myself  
And I opened up the doorway and I headed for the shelf.  
  
Expecting there a rodent or an insect or a bug  
I found a little creature sitting, playing with a mug  
He was green and looked quite slimy and he pushed aside two jars  
Then he tapped his forehead, bowed, and said "I'm Julius, from Mars."  
  
He tussled with his mustache then said "and how do you do?"  
For a moment I was lost and I said "Fine, and how 'bout you?"  
He cracked a little smile and said "Well, and thanks for asking,  
though if you could maybe turn the heat down, man, this vent here's blasting."  
  
I shook the heavy oven mitts and saw them hit the ground  
Two broken jars had fallen there, that must've been the sound.  
"Apologies for that," he said, "I know it's quite appalling,  
I know I knocked two jars off, I suspect you heard them falling."  
  
"I did," I said, "and that is why I'm dressed up like a soldier,  
I'm happy to adjust the heat and try to get it colder.  
I thought the noise I heard, from here, was something like a rat  
Since in this house we have no dog, nor bird, nor fish, nor cat."  
  
He chuckled and he looked my way, then chuckled once again  
As my new green friend hopped down and walked towards the cabinet  
And climbed up to a kitchen chair and looking like he cared,  
said "You know what? I like you, man, your life, here, will be spared."  
  
I laughed and said "Oh, thanks for that" and suddenly I froze  
"Wait, spare my life?" I asked again, "Yes, spare you, I suppose."  
"Spare me from what?" I asked of him, while leaning on the granite  
He told me while still chuckling that he'd destroy our planet.  
  
"That's why I'm here, my brand new friend" he said, still being nice  
"We're here to kill you all and take your water and your ice.  
Mars is too red, it's cold and dead, we're slowly being slaughtered  
But we'll fine if only I can bring us back your water."  
  
While at my kitchen table, Jules and I sat in the room  
I slowly slipped my fingers round the handle of my broom  
He then explained his mission, kill all men and seize the sea  
He'd come and kill us all and then return triumphantly.  
  
But knowing that the outcome here was was that we'd all be dead  
I swung the broom with all my might and smacked the Martian's head  
"That really hurt!" he said to me, a raspy voice of thirst,  
I said I had to get him or he'd kill all humans first.  
  
"Yes, that's my plan, you silly man" he shouted right at me  
I eased the tension handing him a water glass to drink  
"Oh wow, that's truly lovely!" he said offering a smile  
And that's when I struck up a deal that bridged this bitter mile  
  
Two trips to Costco later he was standing by his saucer  
I was loading up Dasani and some Aquafina water  
He said he'd bring the water back and test the Martian rules  
and with that I closed the door and waved to my new best mate, Jules.  
  
A few months later, late at night, a rap came at the door  
It was Julius, my Martian pal, come back for something more  
I anticipated his return and so I had stocked up  
I had cases - pallets! - waiting and a fresh, cold water cup  
  
And thus we struck a deal whereby each year around mid-June  
I expect a knock upon my door, upon the next full moon  
I gather all my friends around and Janice, Dad's step-daughter  
And all of us spend all night long helping to load their water  
  
And in that precious balance hangs a planetary plight  
The peace was forged around my kitchen table that one night  
We help them load, exchanging sweet goodbyes and then good-lucks  
Our peace in remains unless once day, they see Dasani sucks.
