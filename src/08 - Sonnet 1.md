# Sonnet 1 (Poem 8)  
#### March 8, 2021   
  
As nectar spilled from both sides of my mouth  
A bitter sugar gave me certain pause.  
A fruit delivered freshly from the south  
Had jostled me without sufficient cause.  
I felt a longing from within its mesh,  
An aura you could sense surrounding it  
From pinkish-tinted, ever sweetened flesh  
To darkened red wrapped tight around the pit.  
Lest all the buildup be let go to waste,  
Its destiny, perhaps, to satisfy,  
A simple wish to share its ready taste,  
Appreciated by a knowing eye.  
A broadcast of its ripeness gently loomed,  
Desire to be carefully consumed.
