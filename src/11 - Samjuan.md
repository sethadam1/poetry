# The Simple, Yet Magnificent Life of Samjuan, the Fruit Salesman (Poem 11)  
  
> I wrote this poem in 1996, and I think it’s pretty obvious that I was still developing as a poet. The phrase “hunger I did feel” makes me cringe today, and the idea of a “simple, dark, and short” island fruit salesman remains accurate, but with a touch of naive, low-key, 1990s-approved stereotyping. Nonetheless, I still like the idea of a local farmer who knows when fruit is at its peak, and serves a soursop, a common – and delicious – fruit found through the Caribbean that I first experienced on the island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands.   
  
> I always imagined a much grander story taking place in the islands circa 1993. As a result, I wrote a whole story about this for a creative writing class, where a man named Preston travels with his girlfriend Lizzie and friend Bill, where they travel to an island chain called “Los Nubitos” and meet Samjuan. On the largest island, Nube Verde, Preston – implied to be a successful businessman – learns the value of a life of simplicity. He returns to New York, and we revisit him at his desk, unfulfilled, longing for the perfect soursop, beginning to question whether his time in Los Nubitos was real.   
  
> This is the poem that sparked that story.   
  
Samjuan is a market man, he sells the tasty fruit:  
From pineapples to oranges to fresh ground ginger root.  
Samjuan’s known from coast to coast, his food has its own style,  
And anyone will say that it’s the best on this green isle.  
Known to all as simply, “Sam,” and still to others, “Juan,”  
Everyday he sells his fruit until the lot is gone.  
  
Samjuan picked a soursop for Lizzie, Bill and me,  
Chose a ripe one – just today- he pulled it from a tree.  
Lizzie asked to taste a piece as soon as it was ready,  
Samjuan happily obliged, removing his machete.  
Slicing through the lime green skin, the juices spilling down,  
I caught a glance of the tasty meat in the soursop’s ripe crown.  
My mouth began to salivate and hunger I did feel,  
(As every time I open up a soursop I steal)  
But on this special summer day I stand on my two feet  
and feast upon a soursop: today it’s Samjuan’s treat.  
So to be here with good ‘ol Sam — with him selecting fruits  
I find I want to trade my life of papers, bills, and suits.  
  
Finest chooser in the land of every fruity type  
Samjuan knows exactly to the day when fruit is ripe.  
Though he is unlikely so, so simple, dark, and short  
Samjuan is a legend: he's the humble hero sort.  
Though his life is void of things like CDs and TV  
I find that when I look at him I’m green with jealousy.
