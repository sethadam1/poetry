# The Tale of Vernabel Lane (Poem 23)     
#### March 19, 2021   
  
“Whatever became of ol’ Vernabel Lane?”   
that, I think, I recall was the inquiry.  
When I started the tale, which I told without fail,   
I had no idea what was in for me.  
The story began with a man in the sand,   
lost on an African plain,  
he ventured to Britain with his memoirs written,   
he boarded a passenger train.  
He traveled to London, his thoughts were abundant,   
but one idea had been prepared:  
“M-my recollection’s that m-my collection’s   
important and has to be shared.  
“I’m sure that they’ll chase me and try to deface me,   
so never the truth will be known.  
The magic possessed is the devil, in dress,   
it’s witchcraft: c-clear to the bone”  
On bus, train, or lorry he repeated his story,  
"W-witchcraft" he often would utter   
Thought it sounded absurd, he choked on the word   
Cause Vernabel Lane had a stutter   
Now Vernabel Lane wouldn’t moan or complain   
and in traveling to this great nation  
he – not ill prepared – swore to make them aware   
and he brought with him documentation.  
  
The story he told of his origin abode   
made him look of a regular dummy  
The glyphs that he read, were describing instead   
something awfully close to a mummy   
His words were arranged as the evidence changed   
in book, and though some would say reckless,  
The story was clear and was told without fear   
as he told of an amulet necklace  
This part of the story is odd territory   
so now that you’re feeling engrossed   
When place on a wearer, the original bearer   
took over the life of the host.  
Now is this surprising? I feel your doubt rising.   
Extend to me this goodwill:   
Vernabal Lane, to proof himself sane   
held on to that old amulet, still!  
Calling on his alliances, men of great sciences,   
teachers at Oxford and more  
He produced the neck charm and in doing no harm,   
laid the pendant on pillow on floor  
He looked slowly around, and explained what he’d found   
and assured them the necklace was real   
Then he challenged the team – “which of you wants to be   
the first scholar to see how it feels?”   
The crowd, not a noise, they comported with poise   
and expressing a skeptical doubt  
Not a one stepped aside, all were unqualified,   
but they still wanted to find out.  
  
Professor McGann, a mustachioed man,   
turned to his portly colleague LaRue,  
“Heads, it’s I who will try, but if it’s tails side   
then the person we test shall be you.”   
So LaRue had been prodded, and he gently nodded   
expressing his capitulation  
Having both placed their bets, when it landed on heads,   
was clearly displaying elation.   
McGann then stepped hence, and the air was intense   
as he lowered his head for the cause  
When it touched on his neck, and he felt to inspect,   
he stood and awaited applause  
No sound was heard, no one spoke, not a word,   
he wondered “Is this necklace fake?”   
He started to jostle, then froze like a fossil   
and suddenly shivered awake  
When the shaking subside, his eyes snapped open wide   
and then with a voice, restrained  
He turned to the side, met Vernabel’s eye,   
and cried out “Vernabel Lane!”   
  
What’s next, LaRue writes, was the scariest of sights   
he took hold of ol Vernabel’s coat  
Then while sizing his foes, pulled Vernabel close,   
and wrapped his hands tight round his throat  
The guests tried to assist but McGann would resist  
and his strength was no match for the crowd  
He kept hold of the bloke as he started to choke  
and, finally gasping, fell down  
As his eyes bulged and grew, as our hero turned blue  
McGann scanned across the room  
Like he sought their approval, still mad from removal  
“You stole this from my tomb!”    
The folks never guessed what Lane had expressed   
would happen that fateful night  
They thought him a fool and expressed ridicule,   
but Vernabel Lane had been right.  
  
Universal, once freed, the crowd had agreed  
To protect them all from this new danger  
The amulet rock, would remain under lock  
Lest it land in hands of a stranger.  
So ten volunteers watched a lockbox for years  
To protect the world from this affliction   
Soon guarding the room like a milit'ry tomb  
Was obsession and almost addiction   
Shoulder to shoulder, they slowly grew older  
And one day temptation was great  
LaRue ever curious, grew ever more furious  
And slowly pried open the crate.    
Expecting relief, but to his disbelief -   
I don't want to be too dismissing -   
In some paradox, though guarded, the box  
Revealed the old amulet missing.   
  
“Whatever became of ol’ Vernabel Lane?”   
I believe was the question you uttered  
He's no longer a wreck, amulet round his neck,   
And Vernabel no longer stutters.
