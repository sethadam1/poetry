It’s funny I didn't expect what was fragile  
is suddenly breaking like glass  
  
It’s funny how gravity pulls on our lives   
as it pulls on all objects with mass  
  
It’s funny the power your heart can exert   
on your mind and your thoughts when it calls  
  
But picking my head up from out of my hands,   
it doesn’t seem funny at all.
