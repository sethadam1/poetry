# An Iambic Observation (Poem 30)  
#### April 1, 2021             
  
> Is this poem even finished? Hard to know if there was supposed to be more. This was saved both as An Iambic Observation and Rose Colored in my files. It is iambic. But Rose Colored seems like a very different read of the poem, like a skeptical narrator knows his love is a temporary crush. Given when the poem was written, that was probably the intent.    
  
A taste of what it’s like to love  
is on my palette: Nectar sweet  
as honey. I walk down the path  
and wonder, “Did the strangers always  
look and smile as they do now,  
or have I just convinced myself  
they even do at all?”  
  
The world, I think, is not the place  
some people make it out to be.  
We’re capable of such extremes:  
of highest highs and strongest pains.  
  
It's almost like when one's in love  
they see the world for something more:   
the joy they used to overlook  
is suddenly right in their face,   
but when the loneliness wins out,  
the life one leads is painted gray.    
  
Sometimes if you should just sit still  
to listen, let the calm distill,  
and watch the state of those around  
as they conduct their daily lives,   
you’ll see that people change their ways,  
environment, and mental state  
according to their joy.  
  
So when the darkness hovers still -   
a rainy season if you will -    
withdrawing from the world around  
might "prove" your feelings right.      
When goodness shines throughout your day  
it's hard for you to look away   
You "feel" the world is ever-precious  
people smile, it's infectious,   
all because you choose to see  
the world as it could be.
